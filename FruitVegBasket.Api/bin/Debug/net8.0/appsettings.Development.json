//There is a problem with updating database, some sort of SQL exception error

// A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server.
// The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and
// that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections.
// (provider: Named Pipes Provider, error: 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server)

// Dont know how to fix this yet, will look into it later and might have to start again
// with a new project if i cant fix this
